    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>Rava Cake | Sooji Cake | Semolina Cake is a pretty popular Indian cake. Rava cake (eggless) is really easy to make at home, does not require any special equipment or expertise, which makes it a perfect beginner’s cake. You can hardly mess up this cake, it is so forgiving.</p1>

        <p2>This is a basic eggless cake recipe that uses rava/semolina, a little flour, leavening agents, condensed milk and milk. For the fat component, you can choose to add butter, oil or ghee. Use fresh dahi for this recipe, as the sourness of the dahi can ruin the taste of this cake. If you eat eggs, replace the dahi with 2 beaten eggs instead.</p2>

            <h2>Ingredient list</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 & 1/4 cups / 225 grams / 8 oz fine rava/sooji/semolina</li>
                <li>1/4 cup / 35 grams / 1.2 oz all-purpose  flour, spooned & leveled</li>
                <li>1 & 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grease an 8-inch cake tin with little oil or oil spray and dust with flour to coat the pan. Use a parchment paper to line the base of the tin. I used a cake tin with a removable bottom.</li>
                    <li>n a medium bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Add salt, whisk the dry ingredients until well combined. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>In another bowl, measure out the tutti-frutti, add a teaspoon of flour to coat them. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a sufficiently large bowl, add yogurt, whisk it well to get rid of any lumps. Then add milk, oil, sugar, clear vanilla and butter extracts. Whisk well to incorporate all the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>After 30 minutes, the semolina will have absorbed the liquid, the batter will become thicker. After about 20 minutes, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F/180 degrees C, position a rack in the middle of the oven.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the batter to the prepared baking tin. Bake in the middle rack, for about 35 - 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.</li>
                    <li>Cool the cake on a rack in the tin for 15 minutes. Then remove from the tin and cool on the rack completely. Cut into desired pieces and serve.</li>
